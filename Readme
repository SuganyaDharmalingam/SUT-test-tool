*************System under Test (SUT) application for the SCTP test tool (stt)*********************************


This project is designing a SUT application required for the ETSI test cases. The command line tool is used to make a Linux or FreeBSD implementation a SUT for the stt test tool. 

This SUT act as a counterpart for running the test using stt. 
This tool can be used in combination with stt or with itself. Services needed such as (Echo, Discard, Daytime, Chargen) were implemented to support the stt based test cases. 
It is used to make a Linux or FreeBSD implementation a SUT for the stt test tool. 

The SUT application was written in C and uses socket API functions. 
This tool has been executed in both the Linux and FreeBSD operating systems and the client-server communication was tested and analyzed.
